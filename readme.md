# Inspiration

C3 exists to provide a large collection of content that is general enough to be applicable everywhere but specific enough to solve problems organizations face today without modification or advanced coding. The best part about C3 is that it is currently used in production! C3 is made up primarily of content I have created but also relies heavily on other community contributors.
